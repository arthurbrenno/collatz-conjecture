# [üí≠] The Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture, also known as the ‚Äú3n+1 problem,‚Äù remains an unsolved mystery in mathematics. First proposed in 1937 by German mathematician Lothar Collatz, the conjecture suggests that by repeatedly performing two simple arithmetic operations on any positive integer, the result will eventually be reduced to the number one. Despite its apparent simplicity, a proof that the conjecture holds true for all integers has yet to be found. It is possible that for some numbers, the sequence may continue indefinitely without ever reaching one.
